				<h3>Frequently asked questions about missing pages</h3>
				<h4>I’m looking for a tutorial that used to be here?</h4>
				<p>I will no longer post tutorials to my blog. A lot of my tutorials have been moved to <a href="http://tuts.by.georgie.nu/tuts/">tuts.by.georgie.nu</a> (I know, smart URL, huh?). If you don’t find what you want there, I may have deleted it. Chances are, you will find a similar tutorial to the one you were looking for, elsewhere on the internet.</p>
				<h4>I’m looking for photos?</h4>
				<p>In 2014, I moved some of my photoblog posts from the domain Indecisively.me, to here. I have tried my best to redirect all links to their corresponding posts here, however, I may have missed a few. Or it may be the case that the post you are after has been removed. <a href="/contact/">Want to check with me?</a></p>
				<h4>What happened to your free WordPress themes?</h4>
				<p>They were simply not up to standard, and I decided to remove them. They were not responsive/mobile friendly, the HTML was not so well formatted, the CSS could have been minified, and the themes overall could be optimised. At the time I created them, they were quite well done, but in the year 2013, nope. But I was kind enough to save the PHP and WordPress versions <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fk65c586cdinjqy/uVTnaGgyhn">on Dropbox</a>, so have at it, and you’re welcome.</p>
				<h4>Are you going to make more free WordPress themes?</h4>
				<p>No. I’m a busy girl. <em>*cries*</em> Frankly I don’t have time to make free things for people because it takes up a lot of my time and is honestly not a priority right now.</p>
				<p>However, I do paid custom designs if you would like to work with me. <a href="/contact/">Check out my portfolio.</a></p>
				<h4>I came here from somewhere you did a boo-boo.</h4>
				<p>Well, if you don’t mind, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> telling me the page you came from and where the link was so I can fix it!</p>
