Theme build for blog [Hey Georgie](http://hey.georgie.nu). Built by Georgie Luhur. Please respect my work and do not copy ginormous amounts of it without credit.

This WordPress theme was built with handfuls of love and magic. It was inspired by Brisbane pop-rock band Hey Geronimo, and their November 2013 “Erring On The Side Of Awesome” tour poster. Dashed with clouds & rockets, and pink & teal, this theme includes more of the latter.

It was also directly named after their (unreleased) song *Bermuda*.

Originally inspired by postcards and travel, a desire for minimalism (that is, sharp corners, few fonts, barely any transitions) resulted in this responsive, clean design.

Realistically and technologically speaking, though, **bermuda** notably uses [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) for CSS, is built in HTML5 with use of [schema.org microdata](http://schema.org). In case it wasn’t clear – it’s a WordPress build, and contains templates for the index page, individual post, individual page, comments (with threaded comments), search results, category page, 404 page.

Functions and fancies include “nice search”, myriad overrides of ugly default WordPress classes, manual Jetpack subscription widget, removal of yucky WordPress bloat and overall pedantry towards semantic HTML.
