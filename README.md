Theme build for blog [Hey Georgie](http://hey.georgie.nu). Built by Georgie Luhur. Please respect my work and do not copy ginormous amounts of it without credit. This is the main website I work on, both content and coding wise. Coding wise, I know that the performance, UX and UI can be improved and I am always looking to improve. I appreciate suggestions and am always looking for new tricks to make WordPress less bloated and to let it do what I want it to do, so let me know if you have anything to add. :smile:

### v.1.1 ‘Atlantis’ – August 2015

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/atlantis/).

*Atlantis* includes the following changes:

* Change from hot pink and teal branding to coral and a less bright teal, also introducing grey for the footer.
* Unified logo design from a complicated triangle outline and text to a white triangle on a teal background. 
* Swapped out square, ‘blocky’ elements with rounded corners for prominent elements and a smoother design.
* [Converted from Stylus to Sass](http://hey.georgie.nu/stylus-sass/).
* Converted from `em` to `rem` units.
* Improved image caption styling.
* Minor update to mobile navigation (still requires improvement).
* Improved sidebar.

*Atlantis* is named for hilarious enough reasons that the lost city of Atlantis is a story just like the myth of the Bermuda triangle.

### v1.0 – May 2014

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/bermuda-wasnt-built-in-a-day/).

This WordPress theme was built with handfuls of love and magic. It was inspired by Brisbane pop-rock band Hey Geronimo, and their November 2013 *Erring On The Side Of Awesome* tour poster. Dashed with clouds & rockets, and pink & teal, this theme includes more of the latter.

It was also directly named after their (unreleased) song *Bermuda*.

Originally inspired by postcards and travel, a desire for minimalism (that is, sharp corners, few fonts, barely any transitions) resulted in this responsive, clean design.

Realistically and technologically speaking, though, **bermuda** notably uses [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) for CSS, is built in HTML5 with use of [schema.org microdata](http://schema.org). In case it wasn’t clear – it’s a WordPress build, and contains templates for the index page, individual post, individual page, comments (with threaded comments), search results, category page, 404 page.

Functions and fancies include “nice search”, myriad overrides of ugly default WordPress classes, manual Jetpack subscription widget, removal of yucky WordPress bloat and overall pedantry towards semantic HTML.
