Theme build for blog [Hey Georgie](http://hey.georgie.nu). Built by Georgie Luhur. Please respect my work and do not copy ginormous amounts of it without credit. This is the main website I work on, both content and coding wise. Coding wise, I know that the performance, UX and UI can be improved and I am always looking to improve. I appreciate suggestions and am always looking for new tricks to make WordPress less bloated and to let it do what I want it to do, so let me know if you have anything to add. :smile:

### v5.0 ‚ÄòHonolulu‚Äô ‚Äì June 2018

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/honolulu/).

* Introduced brand new logo.
* Added logomark.
* Fun 404 page.
* Restructured SASS files.
* Made use of WordPress `get_template_part()` function.

### v4.0 ‚ÄòFlores‚Äô ‚Äì February 2016

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/flores/).

*Flores* includes the following changes from around the 30th December 2015, along with miscellaneous other updates in between.

* Converted to single column layout.
* Reduced the use of button-link links, using link-looking links instead!
* Completely rolled out [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) naming convention.
* Updated display of post metadata.
* Updated `figure` element to visually expand slightly beyond the width of the text content.
* Updated main navigation to use WordPress‚Äô `wp_nav_menu` function, and removed use of JavaScript.
* Updated post titles to be able to use custom HTML.
* Adjusted styles for `code` element to have a pale background and subtle outline.
* Utilised more WordPress functions instead of hard-coding text in.
* Added creative animation to in-post navigation controls.
* Added blog introduction component to homepage (only displays on homepage).
* Converted media queries to use `rem` instead of `px`.
* Added rotating quote to footer.
* Added function to replace appropriate text such as ‚Äò(:‚Äô with emoji such as ‚ÄòüôÉ‚Äô.
* Restyled search bar and added it to the header, also allowing it to be visible on smaller screens (finally).
* Updated favicons to use the `#7cd7d7` teal rather than the much older bright turquoise.
* Removed a lot of unused code.
* Minor performance improvements.

*Flores* is named after the Indonesian island of the same name, where remains of short (a metre tall) humans and unusually small elephants were found.

### v3.0 ‚ÄòAtlantis‚Äô ‚Äì August 2015

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/atlantis/).

*Atlantis* includes the following changes:

* Change from hot pink and teal branding to coral and a less bright teal, also introducing grey for the footer.
* Unified logo design from a complicated triangle outline and text to a white triangle on a teal background.
* Swapped out square, ‚Äòblocky‚Äô elements with rounded corners for prominent elements and a smoother design.
* [Converted from Stylus to Sass](http://hey.georgie.nu/stylus-sass/).
* Converted from `em` to `rem` units.
* Improved image caption styling.
* Minor update to mobile navigation (still requires improvement).
* Improved sidebar.

*Atlantis* is named for hilarious enough reasons that the lost city of Atlantis is a story just like the myth of the Bermuda triangle.

### v2.0 ‚Äì May 2014

[Release blog post](http://hey.georgie.nu/bermuda-wasnt-built-in-a-day/).

This WordPress theme was built with handfuls of love and magic. It was inspired by Brisbane pop-rock band Hey Geronimo, and their November 2013 *Erring On The Side Of Awesome* tour poster. Dashed with clouds & rockets, and pink & teal, this theme includes more of the latter.

It was also directly named after their (unreleased) song *Bermuda*.

Originally inspired by postcards and travel, a desire for minimalism (that is, sharp corners, few fonts, barely any transitions) resulted in this responsive, clean design.

Realistically and technologically speaking, though, **bermuda** notably uses [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus) for CSS, is built in HTML5 with use of [schema.org microdata](http://schema.org). In case it wasn‚Äôt clear ‚Äì it‚Äôs a WordPress build, and contains templates for the index page, individual post, individual page, comments (with threaded comments), search results, category page, 404 page.

Functions and fancies include ‚Äúnice search‚Äù, myriad overrides of ugly default WordPress classes, manual Jetpack subscription widget, removal of yucky WordPress bloat and overall pedantry towards semantic HTML.
