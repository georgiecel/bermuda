				<?php if (is_category('2 minutes and 40 seconds')) : ?>
					<p><strong>2 minutes and 40 seconds</strong> is an interview segment in which I interview people from any walk of life, and ask them questions outside of the traditional interview format to reveal random facts, suss out their quirks, and provide an enjoyable read. To find out more about this segment and apply for a possible interview, <a href="/2-minutes-40-seconds/">read this page</a>. Not all interviewees are accepted.</p>
					<p>A new ‘2 minutes and 40 seconds’ is posted every second Thursday.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('A Day in the Life')) : ?>
					<p><strong>A Day in the Life</strong> is part of my <a href="/day-life/">‘A Day in the Life’ monthly linkup</a>, which was previously run by <a href="http://breakthesky.net/tag/day-life/">Manda</a> in 2014. In this linkup, bloggers document their daily life once a month.</p>
					<p>I was really excited when Manda started this linkup because I used to do a photography ‘A Day in the Life’ on my photoblog, which was organised by Tracey of sh1ft.org/chasethelight.org. I was happy that she let me take over the linkup from January 2015.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Ballet')) : ?>
					<p>When I was ten years old I started to dance <strong>ballet</strong>. I loved it dearly. At the time I was very excited to learn how to dance, and given that most girls start at a really young age, I think I did really well. I also danced modern jazz, tap and contemporary. Over the years I continued dancing, but because of school and other extracurricular activities, I dropped tap dance, and eventually jazz. It was ballet that I continued to do until 2008, when I took a break for a year and returned to complete my student teacher’s certificate (Advanced Major).</p>
					<p>To this day I still love ballet; going on pointe was so exciting, I learned a lot and honestly kept pretty fit, and although I would need to complete another exam to obtain my complete teaching certificate, I still love ballet very much. Swan Lake still remains my favourite ballet. Will I ever complete my teacher’s certificate? Maybe, maybe one day. It’s still on the cards.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Brandon')) : ?>
					<p>Posts in this category mention my younger brother <strong>Brandon</strong> who recently started a Bachelor of Arts in Pschology. We used to fight and argue a lot when we were younger, but got along better as we grew up.</p>
					<p>We have a lot of funny conversations, and although we have varied interests, we like to share thoughts about music, social events, restaurants, and technology. He calls me Cici (chie-chie) about 99% of the time &mdash; “Cici” means “big sister” in Indonesian &mdash; the other 1% of the time is some variant like Ci, Chip, or Chips.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Daniel')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Daniel</strong> is a friend of mine who resides in Singapore. He is a moderator on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> and is often known as BoltClock online. He’s a good listener, a great writer, and an even better friend!</p>
					<p>Thanks to Daniel I now have a secret dream of being a member of Australian children’s musical group Hi-5, but don’t tell anyone that.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Dylan')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Dylan</strong> is one of my friends from high school. We catch up every now and then, pretty much always at a gig or a concert, over a couple of drinks. I can talk to him about pretty much anything, as he’s an open, non-judgemental guy. We love talking about music.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Family')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Family</strong> contains general posts about my family. You will find that I keep details down to a minimum as I consider this information rather personal. Some of my older posts may contain sensitive information, but in recent years I have refrained from including too much detail about my family to respect their privacy.</p>
					<p>For those curious, my family do know that I have a blog, but they only read a few posts when they initially discovered it (or rather, bothered to actually look! &mdash; they had known for a while that I had one). I do, however, write frequently about my brother <a href="/category/brandon/">Brandon</a>.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Fanlistings')) : ?>
					<p>Since about 2006, I have been somewhat involved with <strong>fanlistings</strong>, as part of <a href="http://thefanlistings.org/">TheFanlistings.org</a>. The network has been around since 2000. Fanlistings are basically small fansites built by web designers for other fans to join and get “listed” &mdash; it is pretty niche now, and in recent years the number of fanlistings listed at the network has greatly decreased. But I still love the network a lot, and have met many lovely people.</p>
					<p>I built my first fanlisting in 2009. It was quite exciting because I had been joining them for years but never thought to open one. My first one, which I still own, was for <a href="http://love.georgie.nu/picks/">guitar picks</a>. You can see more of the fanlistings I own at my fanlisting collective, called <a href="http://love.georgie.nu/">Carbon Affair</a> (after a Hey Geronimo song, of course!).</p>
					<p>In 2010 or so, I became a trouble chcker at The Fanlistings Network, and in 2012 I was appointed as a category staffer for the Websites category. I now also staff the Songs: Bands/Groups: 0-M category.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Fashion Friday')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Fashion Friday</strong> is an fashion segment I started in 2013, where I share outfits or items related to fashion and beauty.</p>
					<p>There used to be a new post each month, on average, but now occurs every second Friday. Some older posts have been posted on Saturday rather than Friday, due to timezones, but are now more consistent. Some Fridays in between may be filled in.</p>
					<p>I would like to thank one of my best friends <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org">Seb</a> for having the time and patience to photograph in some of the more recent posts.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Fern')) : ?>
					<p>Whenever mentioning <strong>Fern</strong>, I tend to also mention <a href="/category/johnny/">Johnny</a> &mdash; the two are my photography buddies who studied photography with me in university. It should also be known that Fern is a guy; his full name is Fernando, and he does get called Nando, but that is an annoying extra syllable for the lazies.</p>
					<p>We have common interests in Futurama and music.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Food')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Food</strong> has posts about restaurants I’ve been to, general posts about foods, meals or diet. I am a really bad cook. I previously had a small category called Cooking on my blog before merging it into the Food category. It covered a lot of what James and I cook together. We love trying new foods and mixing up different flavours. Also, when I say I’m a bad cook, I just mean that I can’t really cook. My preference strays towards raw/unprocessed foods, keeping things very simple &mdash; boil-a-handful-of-carrots-with-spices kind of simple, so I don’t really know how to cook something extravagant.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Friends')) : ?>
					<p>Not <em>really</em> suggesting that they aren’t special, posts in <strong>Friends</strong> mention friends who may not have their own category on my blog. They may not be people I spend a lot of time with, and thus I have not created a category especially for them. I may also mention friends in general.</p>
					<p>For your information, friends that do have their own categories include <a href="/category/nick/">Nicholas</a>, <a href="/category/james/">James</a>, <a href="/category/lilian/">Lilian</a>, <a href="/category/tristan/">Tristan</a>, <a href="/category/dylan/">Dylan</a>, <a href="/category/daniel/">Daniel</a>, <a href="/category/seb/">Seb</a>, <a href="/category/rachel/">Rachel</a>, <a href="/category/ryan/">Ryan</a>, <a href="/category/mike/">Mike</a>, <a href="/category/johnny/">Johnny</a> and <a href="/category/fern/">Fern</a>.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('General')) : ?>
					<p><strong>General</strong> is a bit of a hit and miss. I created the category to account for discussion on general topics not necessarily related to my personal life. This category and the <a href="/category/life/">Life</a> category are a little bit of a mix, but for the most part, posts under this General category are more likely to fuel discussion.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Health')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Health</strong> discusses everything health, though mostly related to my personal life. I have had a countless amount of health issues related to my digestive system and mental illness.</p>
					<p>In particular, I have had two main issues. Firstly, I had a twelve-year battle with high cholesterol despite being extremely thin. I was constantly told that genetics did not contribute to my condition. I tried every diet on the planet to reduce my cholesterol levels, but to no avail.  Visiting a new doctor in 2013 led me to discover that my condition was indeed genetic, and I was put on medication.</p>
					<p>My second issue is related to depression, which I suffered from since 2004. I went through bouts of being suicidal, and self-harmed a lot of the time. I visited a counsellor in 2008, and began taking medication in 2011. I stopped in 2013, feeling a lot better.</p>
					<p>Occasionally, I still get anxious, and there are times I have been extremely stressed and on edge. The last time I recall feeling suicidal was in late 2013, whereupon I called a friend to talk to. It was the first time in about a year that I had had thoughts of suicide.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Internet')) : ?>
					<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> category contains posts that discuss things that might happen online/over the internet. It might also include my opinions or reviews about services or applications. For this reason, posts here may be easy to relate to.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('James')) : ?>
					<p>I properly met <strong>James</strong> in 2004 when he had a fake map and pretended he knew where me and my friend Jennifer were going. We soon discovered his trick.</p>
					<p>James and I were in a relationship from 2008 to 2014. He’s been there for the good times and the bad, and has been there for me when I have needed it, and we remain good friends.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Johnny')) : ?>
					<p>Whenever mentioning <strong>Johnny</strong>, I tend to also mention <a href="/category/fern/">Fern</a> &mdash; the two are my photography buddies who studied photography with me in university. Johnny used to give me rides all the time because he doesn’t live far from me.</p>
					<p>We have common interests in Futurama. That is all.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Life')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Life</strong> is the default category for my blog posts. It usually contains anything to do with my general life, or life at the moment. Recounts of stories from years gone by would appear in <a href="/category/stories/">Stories</a>.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Lilian')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Lilian</strong> is my best (and pretty much only) girl friend, and we’ve known each other for nearly twelve years. We used to have a lot in common but our interests have drifted apart. But &mdash; we are still the best of friends. I trust her with everything.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Love')) : ?>
					<p>You gotta love <strong>love</strong>, right? This category has a lot of posts about relationships, love, boyfriends, dates &mdash; you get the idea.</p>
					<p>A couple of years ago, when I blogged on Heartdrops.org (I still kept the old posts in my archive), I did two projects called The “Love Is” Project and the “I Love” Project, where I asked people to define love, and to tell me what they loved. I displayed the quotes on a rotation on my website, incorporating it into redesigns of my blog.</p>
					<p>The idea was greatly loved by everyone, and though I think I have removed the pages with all of everyone’s answers, you can still view the comments on the posts to see what other people have written.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Mike')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Mike</strong> is one of my university friends, who I got to know through <a href="/category/james/">James</a>. He is also into photography, and we have spent time hanging out as a group. </p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Music')) : ?>
					<p>The <strong>Music</strong> category is one of my biggest categories. Posts in this category are often reviews of concerts I have been to, general discussion about bands I like, my experience playing piano or other instruments, or photos of concerts. Photos of concerts are likely to be in the <a href="/category/photoblog/">Photoblog</a> category as well.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Nicholas')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Nicholas</strong> doesn’t need a lot of words. <a href="/cloud93-2/">Finding cloud ninety-three (part II)</a> is a retelling of how I came to realise he was the love of my life. The poem <a href="/forever-sunshine/">Forever sunshine</a> was written for him.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Photoblog')) : ?>
					<p>The <strong>Photoblog</strong> category is currently “in-progress”. It contains posts that contain mainly photographs, or where the photographs are the focus of the post.</p>
					<p>I had a photoblog for about four years, initially at www.o1s.net from January 2009 to February 2010, which was later located at <a href="http://indecisively.me">Indecisively.me</a>. In late 2013 I made the decision to move the posts from my photoblog here to my blog, because I had been sharing photos at <em>Hey Georgie</em> more often than on my photoblog.</p>
					<p>As at April 2014, I am still gradually moving the posts and removing old and unnecessary posts.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Poetry')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Poetry</strong> contains all the poems I have written in the past few years. Most of the posts have the date when the poem was actually written (as I may have published quite some time after I wrote the poem). Some date back to 2007, and I chose to keep these because they are my favourites. I dearly love poetry &mdash; when I was a lot younger I tended to make them rhyme a lot, before moving into free verse. More recently I have taken a liking to internal rhymes.</p>
					<p>I am really passionate about the technicalities of poetry, making particular use of enjambment (run-on lines), and since poetry is intended to be read out aloud, I insist on commas every time there is a pause. If you would like to hear me reading out one of my poems, take a look at <a href="/fairy-dust/">Fairy Dust</a>.</p>
					<p>If you prefer a list of all poems rather than this category showing excerpts, you can visit <a href="/poetry/">this page</a>.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Rachel')) : ?>
					<p>I’ve yet to actually meet <strong>Rachel</strong> in person, but we have been online friends ever since 2008. She commented on my blog posts a few times, I hosted her website, and we have become really close. We have common interests in music, and we used to Skype call for hours on end.</p>
					<p>She’s been an absolutely marvellous friend and I can’t wait until we meet and have a great time. It is also a running joke that we travel to see each other by purple kayak across the Pacific Ocean. (Thanks Google Maps for suggesting this route when we asked for walking directions.)
				<?php elseif (is_category('Reading')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Reading</strong> contains posts that may discuss books, certain titles that I am reading, or other literature.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Ryan')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Ryan</strong> is one of my university friends, known as the librarian. During university we hung out a lot and did some group work together; it was always a hilarity when he stood next to me and it looked pretty funny because he’s pretty much twice my height.</p>
					<p>We have had a lot of funny moments together, but are definitely due for a meet-up since he moved to a town four hours out of Sydney.</p>
					<p>We are part of an imaginary band called Plushie Force with <a href="/category/seb">Seb</a>, thanks to some mash-up of Seb wanting to buy me a gigantic plushie, and, well, Star Wars.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('School')) : ?>
					<p>I started blogging long before the posts in this category might suggest. In fact, I was in my last year of high school when I started blogging more actively and independently. <strong>School</strong> is unlikely to contain posts that I wrote while I was actually still in school; my oldest post dates to 2009 which is when I was already in university.</p>
					<p>Posts in this category may refer to incidents that happened while I was in school, or may tell stories from that period of time.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Seb')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Seb</strong> (previously Sebby, the name later deemed too childish) is one of my close friends who I met in university. We’ve had our fair share of arguments over time, but obsess over the same things &mdash; Doctor Who, photography, books, and music. I do think that he will be forever grateful for the time I discovered the song <em>Sunsets</em> by Powderfinger &mdash; it was, as he described, a rock song that he saw the video clip for on a television, somewhere, during his first couple of years in Australia, and it was red, and animated, and it was surely an Australian band...</p>
					<p>I vaguely remember thinking, “What a sketchy description”. Nonetheless, my data mining skills (probably strengthened by my Bachelors degree, hah) led me to find a list of animated music video clips and a handful of miscellaneous screen captures of these. I don’t know how, really, that I stumbled upon <em>Sunsets</em> and asked, “Well, could this be it?” and <a href="/lzrgun-manifesto/">as magic would have it</a>, it was it.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Stories')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Stories</strong> is a long-running category &mdash; as of writing this, there are 82 posts in this category. Individual posts in this category generally tell an individual story, and the story could be old or new, but more importantly, is true. I sometimes write about funny things that happened when I was younger (many of these will pop up), some things that may have happened recently, or my experiences with certain things.</p>
					<p>The Stories category was present even on blogs I owned before <em>Hey Georgie</em>, but was often meshed with a category I used to have called <em>idiots</em>, which detailed annoying encounters with people on public transport.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Things I Miss')) : ?>
					<p><strong>Things I Miss</strong> is an occasional segment about things that I miss. It could include places I have been, things I bought as a child, things I used to do, things that have become obsolete or are no longer produced like old television shows, foods, toys, and the like.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Travel')) : ?>
					<p>Since I wanted to avoid creating a category for each country I visited, I created <strong>Travel</strong> &mdash; that way I can also include posts about local trips or day trips. Some countries that may be mentioned in this category include Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Japan.</p>
					<p>My parents are from Indonesia, and a lot of my family lives there. The last time I visited Indonesia was in 2012, when one of my cousins got married. I don’t really like Indonesia in general, mostly because I get strange looks and weird comments because I look really pale compared to people there, and there, pale people are sometimes considered attractive.</p>
					<p>I visited Hong Kong for the second time, in December 2013. I first visited in about 1996 when I was six years old, and apparently lost my first tooth there. I really liked the McDonald’s Happy Meal toys.</p>
					<p>I studied Japanese in high school for about four years. I don’t remember very much of the vocabulary, but I have very good reading ability of hiragana and katakana characters. Kanji not so much, though. I visited Japan in 2013. I absolutely adore their cuisine and culture.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Tristan')) : ?>
					<p>Also known as Toffeecake, Honeydew or Tris, <strong>Tristan</strong> is my sweetest, dearest friend who also happens to live down the road from me. Not technically neighbours, but the definition works. We met in 2013, and I don’t exaggerate when I say he helped me find myself. He’s pretty much my best friend.</p>
					<p>Tristan and I are completely ridiculous in each other’s company &mdash; we’ll go to gigs together and dance; we’ll sing; he’ll probably try to tickle me occasionally; we’ll call each other names (both nasty and cheesy). But honestly, I think I would be lost without him.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('University')) : ?>
					<p>I studied a Bachelor of Arts in Communication (Information and Media) from 2009 to 2011. I also studied a Master of Interactive Multimedia from 2012 to 2013. The latter was extremely challenging as I had been working full-time and also attended classes four nights a week after work.</p>
					<p>I enjoyed a lot of what I did in my Bachelors degree, especially the research work. I also completed minors in film photography and 2D animation. I completed three theses in my media submajor, focusing on the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Young adults’ expression of self in internet spaces</li>
						<li>How people with personal blogs engage in reflective practice</li>
						<li>Twitter’s impact on users’ imagined audience and trust in social networking</li>
					</ul>
					<p>My major (group) project in my Masters degree was focused on creating an online network to support carers of sufferers of Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
				<?php elseif (is_category('Work')) : ?>
					<p>In the <strong>Work</strong> category I post about my experiences with work, both in and out of having a job. I have had two major jobs over the years, one for a small company called The Working Party, and the one I have currently &mdash; as a front-end developer for <a href="http://freelancer.com">Freelancer.com</a>. In the past I worked at an education centre for four years, as a graphic designer and web designer in small jobs, and as a freelancer doing blog design commissions.</p>
				<?php else : ?>
					<p>You are currently viewing the <strong><?php single_cat_title(); ?></strong> category. This category doesn’t have a fancy custom description yet, probably because:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It doesn’t really need one because it’s self-explanatory.</li>
						<li>I haven’t gotten around to it yet because it’s new.</li>
					</ul>
